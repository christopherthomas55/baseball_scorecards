Generates scorebooks as svg files
For now blank, filling in will take a bit.

Maybe can make not blank for end of 2022 season!

# Potential features
- Autofill in names/teams/weather
- In general more customizability in where things go
- Live scoring (a man can dream)

# The dream vision 
- Live scorecards of any game, in any style of scorecard

# Some more fun things if this works
- Generate historical games/season quilts
- Random game generator sent through another simulator?
- Generator game outcomes of super mega baseball LOL
